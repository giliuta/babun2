## Types Reference

### AppointmentFinanceStatus
```
"new" | "completed" | "cancelled"
```
No `"paid"` or `"in_progress"` — Bumpix field research confirmed these three only.

### AppointmentSource
```
"manual" | "online" | "waitlist"
```

### ExpenseScope
```
"company" | "brigade" | "appointment"
```
Three levels:
- `company` — overhead not tied to a brigade (office rent, accounting)
- `brigade` — brigade-level cost (car rent €400/mo, lunch €20/day per person)
- `appointment` — materials purchased for a specific job

### BrigadeType
```
"internal" | "outsource"
```
- `internal` — paid base + % of brigade revenue
- `outsource` — fixed `perJobCostCents` per appointment, no base salary

## Known Open Questions

1. **Discount breakdown of old data** — Historical appointments have a single `discount_amount` but no breakdown into % vs absolute. How to represent in AppointmentFinance?

2. **Week boundaries** — Does the payroll week start Monday (ISO) or Sunday? Affects `generateWeeklyPercent` edge cases.

3. **Role swap mid-week** — If Даня is lead one day and helper another (covering for Юра), how is the % split? One PayrollPeriod per role-segment or a weighted average?

4. **Multi-day jobs spanning brigades** — An installation taking 2 days where brigade changes on day 2: single AppointmentFinance or two? Which brigade gets the revenue?

5. **Даня×2 identity question** — `m-danya-yd` (helper Y&D) and `m-danya-dk` (lead D&K) are modelled as two Master records. If it's the same physical person, how are monthly base salaries summed — one €1000 or two?

6. **Full-load lunch definition** — Does "€20/day lunch" apply only on working days with ≥1 completed appointment, or every calendar day the brigade is active?

7. **Prepayment vs %** — If a client pays a prepayment before the appointment is completed, does the % run on prepayment date or on completion date?

8. **Недостача (cash shortage) handling** — When `DailyReconciliation.differenceCents < 0`, is the shortage deducted from the brigade's next payout or written off? Who approves write-off?

9. **Outsource margin for %** — George Install is paid `perJobCostCents` per job. If we charge the client more, does the margin go into company revenue or is there a separate outsource-margin category?

10. **Refund after payout** — If a client refund is processed after the brigade payout has been marked `paid`, how is the clawback recorded? New negative Expense or a reversal PayrollLine?
