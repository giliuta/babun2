# STORY-048 — Realtime sync

**Status:** `todo` — planning + G1 SQL + G2 hook drafted, awaiting `ok` to integrate.
**Estimate:** 2.
**Dependencies:** STORY-039 (RBAC + tenant_members ✅) — multi-user is a real scenario only after this.
**Blocks:** none.

## Why

After STORY-039, two users can share a tenant. Today User A has to refresh F5 to see the client User B just created. STORY-048 makes data updates flow live:

- A creates client → B's `/dashboard/clients` adds the row without F5.
- A edits an appointment → B's calendar grid updates in place.
- Owner invites Dispatcher → newly-joined Dispatcher's team page shows their own row immediately on first load (already covered by STORY-039), and the Owner's open team page picks up the new row live.

Realtime was deferred in STORY-042 / 044 / 049 / 050 because there was no second user to update. Now there is.

## Decisions (locked 2026-04-30)

- **A1.** Generic `useRealtimeTenantSync<TRow>` hook in `apps/web/src/hooks/`, called once per table from the consumer. 10 calls in `DashboardClientLayout`, plus a few in leaf surfaces that own their own state (`Sidebar` for recurring badge, `/dashboard/recurring/page.tsx`, `TeamSettingsClient` for tenant_members + invitations).
- **A2.** Channel naming: `tenant:<tenant_id>:<table>` — one channel per (tenant, table) pair. 10 channels per logged-in tab.
- **A3.** Filter at the channel level: `filter: 'tenant_id=eq.<id>'`. Defence-in-depth alongside Supabase Realtime's RLS-aware broadcasting.
- **A4.** **`REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`** on all 10 tables so UPDATE/DELETE events carry full row data — needed by Realtime's RLS evaluation and by client-side dedupe (`updated_at` comparison).
- **A5.** Dedupe by `id` + `updated_at`: on UPDATE, replace local row only if `event.new.updated_at > local.updated_at`. On INSERT, replace if id already exists (idempotent). On DELETE, filter out by id.
- **A6.** Reconnect handling via `wasDisconnected` flag on the hook instance. On `closed` / `channel_error`, set true. On the next `subscribed` after that, if true → call `onResync()` so the caller fully refetches the table to backfill events missed during the gap, then reset to false.
- **A7.** DOM events (`babun:clients-changed`, `babun:recurring-changed`) are kept — they're cheap intra-tab signals that complement realtime. Realtime is for inter-tab / inter-device.
- **A8.** Excluded from realtime: `invitations` (Owner-only, low write rate), `appointment_photos` (lazy-load on AppointmentSheet open per STORY-049), `tenants` (rare changes), `auth.users` (out of our schema).
- **A9.** Mobile-PWA-background known limitation: iOS suspends the WebSocket when the app goes to background. On return → SDK reconnects → `wasDisconnected` triggers a full reload. Documented, not blocked.
- **A10.** Multiple browser tabs each subscribe independently (10 channels per tab × N tabs). For Free-tier 200 concurrent connection limit this becomes a problem at ~20 tabs total, well above current usage. Add a `BroadcastChannel` / shared-worker dedupe in **STORY-051c** when scale demands.

## G0 — Inventory (read-only, completed)

`supabase_realtime` publication exists with 0 tables. 10 target tables all have `REPLICA IDENTITY DEFAULT` (PK-based) — we'll upgrade to `FULL` for OLD-row coverage. State + mutator patterns documented in the inventory report (see chat). Excluded tables justified above.

## G1 — SQL migration (`20260430_010_realtime_publication.sql`)

```sql
-- ALTER REPLICA IDENTITY FULL on the 10 multi-user tables so DELETE
-- events broadcast the full OLD row (needed for RLS evaluation +
-- client dedupe).
alter table public.clients                  replica identity full;
alter table public.client_tags              replica identity full;
alter table public.client_tag_assignments   replica identity full;
alter table public.appointments             replica identity full;
alter table public.team_schedules           replica identity full;
alter table public.calendar_settings        replica identity full;
alter table public.day_cities               replica identity full;
alter table public.day_extras               replica identity full;
alter table public.recurring_reminders      replica identity full;
alter table public.tenant_members           replica identity full;

-- Add the 10 tables to the supabase_realtime publication.
alter publication supabase_realtime add table
  public.clients,
  public.client_tags,
  public.client_tag_assignments,
  public.appointments,
  public.team_schedules,
  public.calendar_settings,
  public.day_cities,
  public.day_extras,
  public.recurring_reminders,
  public.tenant_members;
```

Verify after apply:
```sql
select count(*) as published_tables
from pg_publication_tables
where pubname = 'supabase_realtime' and schemaname = 'public';
-- expect: 10

select count(*) as tables_with_full_identity
from pg_class c join pg_namespace n on n.oid=c.relnamespace
where n.nspname='public'
  and c.relname in ('clients','client_tags','client_tag_assignments','appointments',
                    'team_schedules','calendar_settings','day_cities','day_extras',
                    'recurring_reminders','tenant_members')
  and c.relreplident = 'f';
-- expect: 10
```

## G2 — Generic hook

File: `apps/web/src/hooks/useRealtimeTenantSync.ts`. Single generic hook usable for any tenant-scoped table. ~80 LOC. Implementation in chat for review.

API shape:
```ts
useRealtimeTenantSync<TRow extends { id: string }>({
  supabase, table, tenantId, enabled?,
  onInsert, onUpdate, onDelete,
  onResync?,
});
```

The hook:
1. Builds a channel `tenant:<id>:<table>` with `postgres_changes` listener filtered by `tenant_id=eq.<id>`.
2. Maps `INSERT` → `onInsert(new)`, `UPDATE` → `onUpdate(new)`, `DELETE` → `onDelete(old)`.
3. On status `SUBSCRIBED` after a previous `CLOSED` / `CHANNEL_ERROR`, fires `onResync()` once to backfill missed events.
4. Cleans up via `supabase.removeChannel(channel)` in the effect's cleanup.
5. Re-subscribes on tenantId change.

## G3 — Integration

| Consumer | Tables wired | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| `DashboardClientLayout` | clients (+ tags + assignments), appointments, team_schedules, calendar_settings, day_cities, day_extras | wires the bulk via `setClientsState` etc + reload* fallbacks |
| `Sidebar` | recurring_reminders | re-uses `listRecurringReminders` for resync; updates `recurringDue` count |
| `/dashboard/recurring/page.tsx` | recurring_reminders | local items state |
| `TeamSettingsClient` | tenant_members | local members state |

`invitations` not subscribed — Owner can refresh the page or rely on the post-invite-creation local update; low cost.

## G4 — Edge cases

| Case | Handling |
|---|---|
| Optimistic INSERT echo (User A inserts → realtime echoes to A) | Caller's `onInsert` does `setState(prev => prev.find(r => r.id === row.id) ? prev : [...prev, row])` — idempotent. |
| Optimistic UPDATE echo (A updates with T1, server stores T1, echoes T1) | Caller compares `event.new.updated_at` vs local; if equal, no-op. If newer (because B updated after A), replace. |
| Concurrent UPDATE (A optimistic T1, B writes T2) | A's hook receives B's UPDATE event with T2. T2 > local T1 → replace. ✓ |
| DELETE for a row already removed locally | Caller's `onDelete` does `setState(prev => prev.filter(r => r.id !== id))` — no-op if absent. |
| Reconnect after disconnect | `wasDisconnected` flag → resync via `onResync()` re-fetch. |
| Logout while subscribed | DashboardClientLayout unmounts → cleanup unsubscribes all channels. |
| Tenant switch (multi-tenant future) | Hook keyed on tenantId → changing tenantId tears down old subscriptions and creates new ones. |

## G5 — Smoke (10 + 1 races, run on local then prod)

1. Login User A → `/dashboard/clients` (with no clients yet).
2. Login User B (different isolated context, same tenant via STORY-039 invite).
3. **A creates client "Иван А"** → assert B's clients page renders the row within 3s without F5.
4. **B edits the client → "Иван А (edited)"** → assert A's clients page updates the displayed name.
5. **A deletes the client** → assert B's row disappears.
6. **A creates appointment** for tomorrow → assert B's calendar shows the new block.
7. **Cross-tenant isolation**: User C (different tenant) opens a raw `supabase.channel('tenant:<USER_A_TENANT>:clients').subscribe()` → asserted to receive ZERO `postgres_changes` events when A inserts/updates clients (RLS blocks at the channel level).
8. **Echo dedupe**: A optimistic-inserts a client locally → realtime echo arrives → assert no duplicate row in A's UI (idempotent INSERT handler).
9. **Race**: A writes "name: V1" at T1 (optimistic). B writes "name: V2" at T2 (T2 > T1). A's UI initially shows V1; A's hook receives B's UPDATE with T2 → replaces with V2 (no flicker, no skip).
10. **Network blip**: turn off Wi-Fi for 5s → channels close → reconnect → `wasDisconnected` triggers `reloadClients` → state matches DB.
11. **Logout**: A logs out → all channels unsubscribed (verify via Supabase Dashboard's Realtime inspector or via DevTools network tab — websocket closes).

## G6 — Bump + push

`BUILD_VERSION = "v361-realtime"`, `CACHE_VERSION = "babun-v361"`.

## G7 — Production verify

Repeat G5 against `https://babun.app` using a fresh owner + dispatcher pair via STORY-039 invite flow. Tear down via account-delete after.

## Risks

- Echo correctness — biggest correctness risk; covered by smoke 8 + 9.
- RLS leak — Supabase Realtime v2 evaluates SELECT RLS on each event before broadcasting. Confirmed by smoke 7.
- Channel count — 10 per tab (~200 concurrent at ~20 tabs total). Free-tier limit. Defer optimization to STORY-051c (BroadcastChannel / shared-worker dedupe across tabs).
- iOS PWA background — WebSocket suspended; SDK auto-reconnects on return → `wasDisconnected` triggers full reload. Expected behavior.

## Acceptance criteria

1. 10 tables in `supabase_realtime` publication with `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`.
2. `useRealtimeTenantSync` hook works for all 10 tables.
3. Per-tenant filtering via channel filter + RLS evaluation.
4. Optimistic UI not broken by realtime echo (smoke 8 + 9).
5. Reconnect resync works (smoke 10).
6. Smoke 11/11 passed locally + production.
7. `v361-realtime` deployed.

## Out of scope

- Realtime for `invitations` / `appointment_photos` / `tenants` / `auth.users` (see A8).
- Presence indicators ("X is editing this client") — separate STORY.
- Typing indicators.
- Conflict resolution beyond LWW (last-write-wins).
- Cross-tab dedupe via BroadcastChannel / shared-worker — **STORY-051c**.

## Future SaaS extensibility

- Hook is generic by row type — adding a new tenant-scoped table = one more `alter publication ... add table` + one more `useRealtimeTenantSync({ table: '...' })` call.
- `wasDisconnected` resync makes the system tolerant to long-lived sessions and PWA backgrounding without explicit user action.
- BroadcastChannel optimization (STORY-051c) reduces channel count to one Realtime client per browser instead of one per tab.
